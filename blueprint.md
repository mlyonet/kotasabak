# Kota Sabak Webpage Blueprint (v2)

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a modern, corporate-style webpage for the "Kota Sabak" new city development project. The webpage will be inspired by the themes in `readmecontenet.md` and use the images provided in the `images` folder.

## Design and Features

### Design

*   **Theme:** Modern, professional, and visually stunning, showcasing Kota Sabak as a futuristic, sustainable, and prosperous city.
*   **Inspiration:** The story of Saba in `readmecontenet.md` will be used metaphorically to emphasize Kota Sabak's commitment to sustainability, resilience, and building a better future.
*   **Color Palette:** A professional color palette will be used, likely with blues, greens, and whites to represent technology, sustainability, and modernity.

### Structure

The webpage will be a one-page landing page with the following sections:

*   **Hero Section:** A captivating hero section with a background image from the `images` folder and a powerful slogan.
*   **Our Vision:** An "About Us" section explaining the vision and mission of the project.
*   **The Pillars of Kota Sabak:** A section highlighting the core features of the city (e.g., "Green Living," "Smart Technology," "Vibrant Community").
*   **Gallery:** A beautiful gallery showcasing the images from the `images` folder.
*   **Invest in the Future:** A call-to-action section for potential investors or residents.

### Technology

*   **Framework:** React with Vite.
*   **Component Library:** Material-UI (MUI) for a polished and professional UI.
*   **Routing:** `react-router-dom` for future scalability.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Create `blueprint.md`:** Document the new project plan.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Install `@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`, and `react-router-dom`.
3.  **Create Components:** Create new components for each section of the landing page (Hero, Vision, Pillars, Gallery, Invest).
4.  **Styling:** Use MUI's theming capabilities and custom CSS for a unique design.
5.  **Content:** Write compelling copy for each section, inspired by the project's vision and the metaphorical themes from `readmecontenet.md`.
6.  **Images:** Integrate the provided images into the Hero section and Gallery.
7.  **Responsiveness:** Ensure the layout is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.
8.  **Verification:** Test the application for errors and correct functionality.
